# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity + Python Learning Journey

🚀 This repo documents my journey into Python programming and ethical hacking from scratch.

Welcome to my first cybersecurity + Python repository!  
I'm currently learning how to build real-world ethical hacking tools using Python.

## 🔧 What I'm Learning
- Python basics (loops, functions, files, requests)
- Cybersecurity tools (OSINT, port scanners, brute-force)
- Ethical hacking concepts
- Git & GitHub for tracking my progress

## 🛠️ Projects I Will Add Soon
- [ ] Whois Lookup Tool
- [ ] Subdomain Finder
- [ ] Port Scanner
- [ ] Simple Keylogger
- [ ] Website Screenshot Taker

## 📅 Timeline
This repo will be updated as I go through:
- **Ryan John’s Python for Hackers course**
- **NetworkChuck’s tool-based hacking videos**
- And eventually my own custom scripts 😎
